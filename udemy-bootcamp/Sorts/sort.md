# Takeaways
## Quadratic
- "QUADRATIC" Sorts b/c all of them take an average of O(N^2) Time.
- Better w/ small data sets
- Insertion sort is great sorting an array when inserting in an array and sorting it in real time.

- Bubble Sort => Sorting ascending, and doing consecutive swaps and bubbling the greatest values at the end
- Selction Sort => Sorted ascending, doing single swaps on each iteration, placing the lowest values in the beginning
- Insertion SOrt => From left to right, examine each item and compare it to the items on its left. Insert the item to its correct location.n
